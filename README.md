# Lottery Game
Interactive Lottery Game â€“ Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript!
Excited to unveil my latest project: a Lottery Game that blends fun and code! ðŸŽ° Users pick a number (1â€“30) to reveal a randomized prize, like the "Headphones" shown here for number 17. Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game showcases dynamic UI interactions and creative front-end development.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features:
âœ… 30 Unique Prizes â€“ From umbrellas to watches, each number unlocks a surprise item.
âœ… Instant Win Animation â€“ Smooth transitions and visual feedback when a prize is revealed.
âœ… Responsive Design â€“ Works seamlessly across devices, thanks to mobile-first CSS.
âœ… JavaScript Logic â€“ Random prize generation using Math.random() and DOM manipulation for real-time updates.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack:

HTML5 (Semantic structure for the prize grid)
CSS3 (Styling, animations, and responsive layouts)
JavaScript (Game logic, event listeners, dynamic content rendering)

Creating this game honed my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and user engagement design. Itâ€™s a playful yet practical example of how front-end technologies can turn simple ideas into interactive experiences. Whether for a giveaway app or a learning tool, the possibilities are endless!
